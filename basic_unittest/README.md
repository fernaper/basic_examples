# Code example using dataclasses and unittest

In this repo we can check the basic ussage of dataclasses (and some inheritance with dataclasses), unitest and coverage information.

To use this project you will need to install coverage with:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

Then you should execute the testing system with:

```bash
coverage run tests/parking_test.py
```

Finally you can generate your coverage information with:

```bash
coverage html
```

And visualize everything on your browser.
